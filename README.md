# Detect Numbers from Live Video using EasyOCR

This project demonstrates how to use EasyOCR to detect and extract numbers from a live video feed captured by a webcam. The script processes each video frame in real-time to identify and highlight numerical text. This can be useful for applications such as automatic license plate recognition, reading speed signs, and other scenarios where number detection from video is required.

## Features
